# [2.0.0] - 2024-08-04

## Breaking Changes
- **Peer Dependencies**: Dropped support for React versions 0.14.0 and 15.x. The library now requires React versions ^16.14.0, ^17.0.0, or ^18.0.0. Projects using this library must update to these versions to avoid compatibility issues.

# [2.0.1] - 2024-10-26

## Fixes
